## Documentation

To run the automation user need to have Node latest version and Java 8 or higher version.

This is a Page Object Model based automation where I have used Playwright.

Moreover,this is a data-driver based frameword.here I have used naode packages. 

To get report after completing run, I used allure reporter. This helps to generate screenshot and videos to if any error occurs.
